session.vim is the easy way to do vim sessions.  A session is automatically started or restored whenever you open vim with a single file, or no files.

To delete a session, type :Sdelete, and the session will be deleted upon exiting vim.

To prevent a session from starting, use the g:session_blacklist variable:
let g:session_blacklist = ['\.swp$','\.tmp$','^\.']

There is also a g:session_whitelist variable for easy refinement.
let g:session_whitelist = ['^\.vimrc$']
